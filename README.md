# Getting Started with ATG-World APP

This project was bootstrapped with `ReactJS` and all the routes has been integreted with `react-router-dom`. For front-end design I have used `Tailwind CSS` and `daisyui`(a tailwind css library component) for some component operation such as modal, dropdown etc. For icons I have used `react-icons` and and `font-awsome icon`. `react-hot-toast` has been used for toaster messages. And, I have used `react-hook-form` for form data submission in SignUp, SignIn and AddPost(publish post) component. After siging up as a user, user credentials will be saved on browser local storage along with a
access token which will be needed later on signing into the web application. Current user logged on the application can be get from local storage with context and be used for conditional rendering and private routes.
